What does it mean? A framework for prototyping Montague-style semantics


One approach to study the meaning of natural language is to translate
utterances to logical expressions, which have well-defined semantics and allow
for rigorous inference.  Richard Montague, a well-known pioneer of this
approach, described the translation of a particular subset of English into
logic in great detail.  Over the years, there have been many similar
publications that propose a novel way to translate sentences into a logic
(often first-order logic, but more obscure logics are also common).  Sometimes,
the approach was extended with pragmatic analysis based on logical inference.

We claim that research (and education) in this direction could benefit from
more prototyping to test and demonstrate new ideas.

In this talk, I will present GLIF, a declarative framework for prototyping the
translation of natural language to logics.  GLIF combines existing, specialized
frameworks that solve part of the problem: the Grammatical Framework
(development of natural language grammars), MMT (logic development) and ELPI
(inference).  These frameworks can be connected seamlessly because of their
compatible underlying logical frameworks.  We successfully use GLIF in a
lecture on symbolic natural language semantics.
