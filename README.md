## README.md

I use this repository for developing slides.
It is public because
* I didn't see a reason why it shouldn't be,
* maybe someone will find something interesting here.

My development policy for slides can be summarized as
* try to have as much as possible in re-usable modules (`slides` folder)
* there may be breaking changes after a presentation (therefore I upload the final pdf)
* use macros to keep everything as consistent as possible (`utils` folder)
* learn what the policy should have been and adjust accordingly
